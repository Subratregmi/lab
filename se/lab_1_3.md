#  Draw a use case diagram for the following problem

# 1.
Consider a library, where a member can perform two operations: issue book and return it. A book is issued to a member only after verifying his credentials. Draw a use case diagram for the problem. 
- Identify the actors and use cases
- Associate the use cases with the actors by drawing a simple use case diagram

# 2. 
 Consider your neighbouring travel agent from whom you can purchase flight tickets. To book a ticket you need to provide details about your journey i.e. on which date and at what time you would like to travel. You also need to provide your address. The agency has recently been modernized. So you can pay either by cash or by card. You can also cancel a booked ticket later if you decide to change your plan. In that case you need to book a new ticket again. Your agent also allows you to book a hotel along with flight ticket. While canceling a flight ticket you can also cancel hotel booking. Appropriate refund as per policy is made in case of cancellation. 

 - Identify the use cases from a given non-trivial problem statement
 - Identify the primary and secondary actors for a system
 - Use to generalization of use cases and «include» stereotypes to prevent redundancy in the coding phase
